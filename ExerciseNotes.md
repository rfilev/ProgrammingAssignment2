#Structure of the exercise

The exercise was developed based on the example code of programming assignment.
The first step was use the same functions of the example, changing the vector by a matrix and mean function to solve function.

##Proposes changes
In the exercise I created a function called createSquareMatrix that creates a square matrix with random values. It is needed to inform the number of lines as parameter.

The function also checks de determinant of matrix (must be different from zero).

THe second function is called checkExerciseCorrectness to test some matrices. It checks whether the inverse is correct (testing using identity matrix).
